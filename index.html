		<h1 style="text-shadow: 2px 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Welcome to my Home Page </h1>
		
		<p> My name is Josh, and this is my college final but this will eventually be my personal website for mostly all of my music projects. 
		But I also mess with computers, electronics, and anything I find interesting in the moment.</p>
		
		<h2>The Purpose of the Site<h2>
		<p>This basically doubles as an about section but in its current state here and the website as a whole is a skeleton for whatever music content I create. 
		A lot of choices were made for that purpose and that purpose alone. I shoehorned in some content, had some fun, and gave it some purpose beyond "just a grade".
		The purpose was more so for learning and connecting with the topic beyond surface level, though a lot of what I learned never got used I am still glad I learned them.
		If you're one of my classmates reading this. I do want to state for the record: creating your website for a grade is far from a bad thing and what I am doing 
		is risky and stupid. If you're Professor Harkness, I apologize for the confusion. Normally your supposed to design it like some job resume or something more grounded. 
		</p>
		
		<p>I don't really mind taking a small hit to the grade if it means that I had some fun learning a topic I don't normally like interacting with and despite
		everything. After all learning should be fun and I had quite a bit of fun creating this, though I do wish I had more time to finish at least one song to display on this site and am a little displeased
		about shoehorning in a (lackluster) practice recording and a placeholder sfx for the music page. Though I did get to use the best collaborator ever for the Collaborations page, 
		however unhuman they were.</p>
		
		<p>To anyone reading this, Be it professor or classmate. I hope you can appreciate the audacity of such an unconventional route for a college final even if a bit annoying.
		But I promise, I mean no malice out of it. I just wanted to enjoy the process and learn, in which I sure did.</p>
		
		<p>For site content you can click on the nav links above. <b>Blog</b> to read what I am working on, <b>Music</b> for any music projects I upload, as of
		right now it doesn't have much of anything, <b>Collaborations</b> for projects I may work on that involve help of other people, and the <b>Contact</b> 
		to send a message if so desired. There is also a comments section in their for anyone the webdev class to use for the Week 15's discussion board assignment.</p>

				<p>I never really intended to have this functionality when planning the site. Makes me wish

				<h2>Disclaimer: Repairing a CRT monitor or TV is extremely dangerous due to the high voltage inside, even when the monitor or TV is turned off. Additionally, the glass tube can implode if mishandled, causing serious injury. Handle with utmost caution and only attempt repairs if you are experienced and aware of the risks.</h2>

				<p>Here is a CRT Television I recently Restored, got Atari Pitfall displaying on it in this image.
				From the dinosaur era without TV remotes for TV's. The Tube surprisingly has a lot of life in it and
				though it looks like there are image alignment issues. There is none, I guess this TV just hates Atari
				because it looks fine on the Sega Genesis.</p>

				<p> I thought the lights off might help with this picture, it didn't but anyhow.
				Not much work needed to be done, a full capacitor replacement and dusting. I took an image before
				I finished cleaning and recapping and this is what it looked like while I was working on it. I did a light
				clean at the time but didn't fully clean the inside yet. Also I don't feel like tearing off the back to take 
				another picture so this is all you get.</p>

				<p> Glad to see this thing working, too bad this thing will eventually stop working... forever. But I will
				enjoy it while I can.</p>

			<p> I have to put a table in here and thought it might be fun to do one showing various 
			skills I have aquired, my experience level, and my reasoning for putting my experience level 
			where it is. Mobile users sorry, you have to deal with a list. Though it was recommended by my professor to do experience levels, I think he
			meant strictly computer related but I will add on to it.</p>
