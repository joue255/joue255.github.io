				<h3>Test</h3>
				<p>This is a test sound, this test the functionality of audio files. A simple pop sound until the first piece of content is created.</p>

				<h3>Improvised Organ Practice</h3>
					<p>I recommend lowering the volume before listening to this.</p>
					<p>This was a practice recording and was done on my phone hence the poor quality and the background noise. I think I was a month in learning the 
					instrument back in September. The focus was improvising based on feel, I used my Hammond Organ and drove the organ's audio signal to a Fender 
					Champion 20 Guitar Modeling Amp. I cranked the gain to push into overdrive and incorporated heavy use of Wah FX and dynamically played by adjusting 
					drawbar settings, adjusting eq and a load of other settings on both the organ and the amp which I had perched on top of the organ. The result was an 
					eerie almost cinematic quality of playing, it was weird sounding and has rough spots but it grew on me and I liked it enough so I kept the entire video.
					Though you guys only get the audio.</p>
					
					<p>More likely I will explore this specific distorted organ sound in the future as under better recording circumstances it can sound really good.</p>

			<h3>Improvised Organ Practice Full Video</h3>
			<p>I recommend lowering the volume before listening to this.</p>
			<p>This is the full video of the practice shown above. I never intended to actually show this at first but decided to after all.
			Nothing groundbreaking here and the audio is not good. But for one month of practice this wasn't too bad and so I kept it. Mostly as a
			reference for this specific sound that I created. The tone changes constantly throughout the 5 minutes and it was a lot of fun to play.</p>
